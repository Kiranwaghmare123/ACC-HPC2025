# Assignment 1
### NumPy Practice / Lab Questions
    1.	Student Marks Analysis
    o	Write a Python program using NumPy to create a 1D array of student marks.
    o	Find and display the mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of the marks.
    
    2.	Matrix Operations
    o	Create two 3×3 NumPy matrices with integer elements.
    o	Perform and display the results of addition, subtraction, and matrix multiplication between the two matrices.
    
    3.	Temperature Conversion
    o	Create a NumPy array containing temperature values in Celsius.
    o	Convert all values to Fahrenheit using vectorized operations (Formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32).
    o	Display both Celsius and Fahrenheit arrays.
    
    4.	Sales Report Analysis
    o	Generate random daily sales data for 10 consecutive days using NumPy’s random functions.
    o	Calculate and display:
    	Total sales
    	Average (mean) sales
    	The day number with the highest sales.
    
    5.	Conditional Extraction
    o	Create a NumPy array of integers.
    o	Use boolean masking to extract and print all even elements from the array.
    o	Verify the output by comparing it with manual filtering logic.
    
    6.	Create a DataFrame Create a DataFrame with employee details (Name, Age, Department, Salary).
    o	Add a new column for "Bonus = 10% of Salary".
    o	Display only employees in "IT" with salary > 50,000.
    
    8.	CSV Operations Read a CSV file of student marks.
    o	Display top 5 records.
    o	Find the average marks of all students.
    
    10.	Handling Missing Values Create a DataFrame with some missing data.
    o	Fill missing values with the mean of the column.
    o	Drop rows that still contain missing values.
    
    12.	Grouping Data Group a DataFrame of sales by region and find total sales in each region.
    
    13.	Data Merge Merge two DataFrames:
    o	students (id, name)
    o	scores (id, marks) Display merged data showing student name and marks.
    
    14.	Basic Line Plot Create a line plot for monthly sales data. Label axes and title the plot “Monthly Sales Trend”.
    
    15.	Bar and Pie Plot Plot a bar chart showing the number of students per department (e.g., CS, IT, ECE). Also, represent the same data using a pie chart.
    
    16.	Scatter Plot Analysis Plot a scatter plot showing “Hours Studied” vs “Exam Score” and analyze the relationship.
    
    17.	Histogram Plot Create a histogram for the ages of 50 employees to visualize the age distribution.
    
    18.	Subplots Practice Display four different plots (line, bar, histogram, scatter) using subplots (2x2 grid).
